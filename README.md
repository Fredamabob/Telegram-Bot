## Introduction <a id = "intro"></a>
This is a basic bot for the Telegram messaging app. This bot is wrtten in Python and is being developed with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) provided by [datamachine](https://github.com/datamachine/twx.botapi). The documentation for the API that I used is located [here](http://pythonhosted.org/twx.botapi/twx/botapi/botapi.html#)


##Usage <a id = "use"></a>
To use this bot, simply clone the repo and run telegram-bot.py like so
<pre><code>
	python telegram-bot.py
</code></pre>
Here is a sample run of the bot on startup

Of course, to fully implement the bot, you will need to make a [Telegram account](https://telegram.org/) so you are able to interact with the bot. Once this is done, you can test the bot yourself or add him to a group chat.
